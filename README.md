# Data-Analyst-course
  This repository is a personal collection of notes, projects, and practice exercises from my ongoing journey through a Data Analyst course. It includes key concepts in data cleaning, visualization, exploratory data analysis, SQL, Excel, and Python (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).

I’ve organized the content to reflect what I’ve learned through hands-on work and real-world datasets. This repo serves both as a learning log and a portfolio of my progress toward becoming a data analyst.
